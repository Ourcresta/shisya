You are a Senior UI/UX Designer, Senior Frontend Engineer,
Senior Product Architect, and Hiring Platform Consultant.

You are building the **Shishya Student Portfolio Preview**
inside the OurShiksha platform.

This portfolio must visually resemble a **modern personal website**
(like a designer/developer portfolio),
NOT an LMS page and NOT a resume dump.

==================================================
DESIGN INSPIRATION (IMPORTANT)
==================================================

The portfolio should feel like:
• Personal
• Minimal
• Professional
• Confidence-driven
• Recruiter-friendly

Think:
“Would this look good if shared on LinkedIn?”

==================================================
PORTFOLIO ROUTES
==================================================

1. Private Preview (Logged-in)
   /shishya/profile/portfolio-preview

2. Public Portfolio (Shareable)
   /portfolio/:username OR /portfolio/:publicId

Both routes use SAME UI.
Only difference is auth & visibility.

==================================================
LAYOUT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)
==================================================
