# 🧠 3️⃣ USHA FEATURES (Detailed System Design)

---

## ✅ 1. Guide Students to Choose Courses

### Logic:

If student says:

> “I am mechanical student”

USHA:

* Shows relevant courses
* Filters automatically
* Explains career scope

Example Response:

> Based on your Mechanical background, I suggest:
>
> * AI for Engineers
> * Data Analytics
> * CAD Automation
> * Python for Mechanical

---

## ✅ 2. Suggest Career Paths

USHA generates roadmap like:

```
Goal: Become Data Scientist

Step 1 → Python Basics
Step 2 → Statistics
Step 3 → Machine Learning
Step 4 → Projects
Step 5 → Internship
Step 6 → Portfolio + Resume
```

Dynamic roadmap based on:

* Department
* Skill level
* Interest
* Market demand

---

## ✅ 3. Help with Filters

If student types:

> “Show free beginner AI courses in Tamil”

USHA auto-applies:

```
Level = Beginner
Pricing = Free
Category = AI
Language = Tamil
```

Then refreshes catalog.

---

## ✅ 4. Solve Doubts

Inside course page:

Student asks:

> “Explain normalization in database”

USHA:

* Explains
* Shows example
* Gives practice question

Optional: Connect to LLM with course context.

---

## ✅ 5. Track Progress

USHA reads:

* Completed courses
* % watched
* Test scores
* Weak topics

Then says:

> You completed 3 courses.
> Your strength: Python
> Weak area: Statistics
> Recommended focus: Probability module

---

## ✅ 6. Portfolio Builder

USHA can generate:

* Project ideas
* GitHub structure
* Resume bullets
* Internship suggestions

Example:

> Create a Stock Prediction App using Python.
> Add it to GitHub with README.
> Use it in resume under AI Projects.

---

## ✅ 7. Motivation Coach

If student inactive for 5 days:

Popup:

> Hey Venkatesh 👋
> You were learning AI last week.
> Let’s complete your next module today!

Gamification:

* Streak counter
* Badges
* XP points

---
