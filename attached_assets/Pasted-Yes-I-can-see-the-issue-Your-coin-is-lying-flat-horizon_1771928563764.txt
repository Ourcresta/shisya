Yes 🔥 I can see the issue.

Your coin is lying **flat (horizontal like a plate)** instead of **standing vertical like a real coin**.

Right now it is rotated on the wrong axis.

---

# 🎯 WHY THIS HAPPENS

Three.js `CylinderGeometry` is created like this:

```
Height → Y axis
Circular faces → Top & Bottom
```

So by default:

* Coin faces are facing UP and DOWN
* That’s why it looks like a flying plate

But a real coin should face the CAMERA (front-facing).

---

# ✅ FIX: ROTATE THE COIN 90° ON X AXIS

You need this line:

```js
coin.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
```

NOT:

```js
coin.rotation.x = 0.3;   ❌
```

---

# ✅ CORRECTED main.js (ONLY FIXED PART)

Replace your initial rotation section with this:

```js
// Correct orientation (make coin stand vertical)
coin.rotation.x = Math.PI / 2;
coin.rotation.y = 0.3; // slight angle for premium look
```

---

# 🎯 ALSO FIX AUTO ROTATION

Since the coin is now vertical, rotate on Y axis only:

Change this:

```js
coin.rotation.y += 0.01;
```

Keep this (correct):

```js
coin.rotation.y += 0.01;
```

Do NOT rotate X continuously anymore.

---

# 🏆 FINAL CORRECT ANIMATION LOOP

```js
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);

  // Smooth rotation like real coin
  coin.rotation.y += 0.01;

  // Floating effect
  coin.position.y = Math.sin(Date.now() * 0.001) * 0.2;

  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

# 🎥 VISUAL RESULT AFTER FIX

Before:
🛸 Flying UFO

After:
🪙 Proper Standing Coin

* Faces camera
* Spins left-right
* Looks real
* Premium depth

---

# 🚀 OPTIONAL (If Still Slightly Wrong)

If texture looks upside down:

Add:

```js
coin.rotation.z = Math.PI;
```

---

# 🧠 PRO TIP (Professional Setup)

For perfect alignment:

```js
geometry.rotateX(Math.PI / 2);
```

Instead of rotating mesh.

That makes geometry itself correct.
