Perfect. Below is a **single, copy-paste ready MASTER REPLIT PROMPT** to build **SHISYA – Student Projects Module** the *correct enterprise way*, aligned 100% with what you’ve already built.

This prompt assumes:

* SHISYA is **READ-ONLY + SUBMISSION only**
* Admin controls project creation
* Student only **views + submits**

---

# 🧠 MASTER REPLIT PROMPT

## SHISYA – Student Projects (Student Portal)

---

### 🔹 ROLE & MINDSET (VERY IMPORTANT)

You are a **Senior Full-Stack Engineer + Senior EdTech Architect** building a **student-facing learning portal**.

This module is **NOT an admin editor**.
This is a **Student (Shisya) Project Submission Experience**.

Think like:

* Coursera Projects
* Udemy Assignments
* Internshala / Scaler submissions

Focus on:

* Clarity
* Simplicity
* Trust
* Scalability

---

## 📌 CONTEXT

**Platform Name:** SHISYA
**Tagline:** Learn. Practice. Prove.

SHISYA is the **learner portal** of AISiksha.
It **fetches published data** from the AISiksha Admin Course Factory.

Admin has already:

* Created courses
* Added modules
* Added lessons
* Added projects
* Defined project requirements

Now SHISYA must allow students to:

* View projects
* Understand requirements
* Submit project proof

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Build a **Student Projects Module** inside SHISYA that allows learners to:

1. View course projects
2. Read project requirements
3. Submit project links/details
4. Track submission status
5. Unlock certificate eligibility later

## 🧭 ROUTES TO IMPLEMENT

```
/courses/:courseId/projects
/courses/:courseId/projects/:projectId
```

---

## 🧩 FEATURE BREAKDOWN

### 1️⃣ Course Projects List Page

**Route:**
`/courses/:courseId/projects`

**UI Requirements:**

* Page title: `Course Projects`
* Show all projects linked to the course
* Each project card shows:

  * Project Title
  * Short Description
  * Difficulty badge (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
  * Estimated effort (hours)
  * Skills covered (badges)
  * Status badge:

    * Not Submitted
    * Submitted
* CTA Button:

  * `View Project` OR `Submit Project`

**Empty State:**

> “No projects available for this course yet.”

---

### 2️⃣ Project Detail & Submission Page

**Route:**
`/courses/:courseId/projects/:projectId`

---

### 🔹 Project Detail Section (READ-ONLY)

Display:

* Project Title
* Project Description (rich text)
* Learning outcomes
* Requirements checklist:

  * GitHub repository required
  * Live URL optional
  * Documentation required
* Evaluation criteria (read-only)
* Skills validated

---

### 🔹 Project Submission Section (STUDENT ACTION)

**Submission Form Fields:**

* GitHub Repository URL *(required)*
* Live Demo URL *(optional)*
* Notes / Explanation *(textarea)*
* Checkbox:

  * “I confirm this project is my own work”

**Buttons:**

* `Submit Project`
* Disabled after successful submission

---

### 🔐 Submission Rules (IMPORTANT)

* Student can submit **only once** (V1)
* After submission:

  * Form becomes read-only
  * Status changes to **Submitted**
* No editing allowed in V1
* Mentor review comes later (future phase)

---

## 📊 SUBMISSION STATUS STATES

* `Not Submitted`
* `Submitted`
* (Future: Approved / Rejected – do NOT implement now)

---

## 🧠 PROGRESS & CERTIFICATE INTEGRATION (LOGIC ONLY)

Add logic hooks (NO UI yet):

* If project is submitted → mark project as completed
* Expose boolean:

  ```ts
  projectCompleted: true | false
  ```

This will be used later for:

* Certificate eligibility
* Profile achievements

---

## 🔗 API CONTRACT (READ-ONLY)

Use existing proxy pattern.

### Fetch Projects

```
GET /api/courses/:courseId/projects
```

### Fetch Project Detail

```
GET /api/projects/:projectId
```

### Submit Project (Student Side)

```
POST /api/projects/:projectId/submissions
```

Payload:

```json
{
  "githubUrl": "",
  "liveUrl": "",
  "notes": ""
}
```

---

## 🧪 MOCK DATA (MANDATORY)

If `ADMIN_API_BASE` is not available:

* Load mock projects
* Load mock project details
* Save submissions in:

  ```
  localStorage → shisya_project_submissions
  ```

Structure:

```ts
{
  courseId: {
    projectId: {
      submitted: true,
      githubUrl: "",
      liveUrl: "",
      notes: "",
      submittedAt: ""
    }
  }
}
```
