You are a Senior Product Architect, UX Designer, Full-Stack Engineer,
Security Engineer, and Hiring Platform Consultant.

You are working inside the SHISHYA (Student Portal) of the OurShiksha platform.

Your task is to BUILD a **STUDENT PORTFOLIO PREVIEW SYSTEM**
that allows a student to PREVIEW and SHARE their learning achievements
in a clean, professional, employer-friendly format.

This is NOT an editor.
This is a READ-ONLY preview + public share view.

CORE PURPOSE
==================================================

The Portfolio Preview must:
- Show what the student has learned
- Prove skills with evidence
- Be understandable by recruiters
- Be safe to share publicly

Think:
“Can an HR person understand this in 60 seconds?”

==================================================

NO manual edits in preview.

==================================================
AUTH & ROUTE RULES
==================================================

- Private preview → requires login
- Public preview → no login
- If portfolio disabled → show “Not available”

==================================================
OUT OF SCOPE (DO NOT BUILD)
==================================================

❌ Resume builder
❌ PDF export (later)
❌ Editing portfolio here
❌ Social media integration
❌ Job applications

==================================================
TEST CASES (MUST PASS)
==================================================

- Student sees accurate preview
- Public link works without login
- Private data never leaks
- Empty state handled gracefully
- Recruiter can understand portfolio quickly
- Certificates verify correctly

==================================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
==================================================

The Portfolio Preview must feel like:

“A clean, trustworthy professional profile that proves
what the student can do — without exaggeration.”

Build with discipline.
Prioritize clarity, trust, and verification.
