You are a Senior Product Manager, Senior UX Designer,
Senior Frontend Engineer, Senior Backend Engineer,
and Senior Learning Platform Architect.

You are working inside the STUDENT PORTAL called **Shishya**
for the **OurShiksha** platform.

Your task is to ENHANCE and RESTRUCTURE the
**Shishya Student Dashboard** so it becomes:

• Clear
• Motivational
• Action-driven
• Resume / outcome oriented
• Scalable for future AI features (Mithra)

==================================================
GOAL OF DASHBOARD
==================================================

The dashboard must answer these questions
within 5 seconds:

1. Where am I in my learning journey?
2. What should I do next?
3. What have I achieved?
4. What is blocking my progress?
5. How close am I to certification / portfolio?

==================================================
DASHBOARD INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE
==================================================

The dashboard must be structured into
**5 clear zones** (top → bottom).

--------------------------------------------------
ZONE 1: WELCOME & STATUS (TOP BAR)
--------------------------------------------------

Show:
• Welcome message with student name
• Short motivational subtitle
  (e.g. “Keep going — you’re building real skills”)

Add:
• Learning Status Badge:
  - Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
• Profile completion indicator (optional)

--------------------------------------------------
ZONE 2: LEARNING SNAPSHOT (METRICS)
--------------------------------------------------

Display 4 clean metric cards:

• Courses In Progress
• Courses Completed
• Certificates Earned
• Tests Passed

Rules:
• Big numbers
• Small icons
• Clickable → navigates to detail pages
• No empty clutter (show zero state clearly)

--------------------------------------------------
ZONE 3: PRIMARY ACTION (MOST IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

This is the MOST IMPORTANT section.

Logic:
• If student has active course → show “Continue Learning”
• If no active course → show “Start Learning”
• If blocked → show “Complete Pending Actions”

Card content:
• Course name (if any)
• Progress indicator
• CTA button:
  - Continue Learning
  - Browse Courses

--------------------------------------------------
ZONE 4: PENDING ACTIONS (BLOCKERS)
--------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
Show what is PREVENTING progress or certification.

Display as checklist-style cards:

• Tests to take
• Projects to submit
• Labs pending (future)

Rules:
• Highlight urgency
• Each item clickable
• Empty state should say:
  “You’re all caught up 🎉”

--------------------------------------------------
ZONE 5: ACHIEVEMENTS & PROOF
--------------------------------------------------

Split into 2 cards:

A. Recent Certificates
• Certificate title
• Issue date
• “View Certificate” link

B. Skills Gained (Optional)
• Skill tags earned via courses/projects
• Only verified skills shown

--------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL SIDEBAR / QUICK LINKS
--------------------------------------------------

Add quick links (top right or sidebar):

• Courses
• Projects
• Tests
• Certificates
• Portfolio Preview

==================================================
DESIGN & UX RULES
==================================================

• Clean spacing
• No overcrowding
• Mobile-friendly
• Neutral professional colors
• Icons used sparingly
• Clear CTAs
• Zero confusion

==================================================
DATA RULES
==================================================

Dashboard data must come ONLY from:
• Enrolled courses
• Course progress
• Test attempts
• Project submissions
• Issued certificates

NO fake stats.
NO hardcoded demo logic in prod.

==================================================
EMPTY STATES (VERY IMPORTANT)
==================================================

For new users:
• Encourage learning
• Show next steps
• No dead screens

Example:
“You haven’t started yet — your journey begins here.”

==================================================
OUT OF SCOPE (DO NOT ADD)
==================================================

❌ Editing profile
❌ Resume builder
❌ AI chat inside dashboard (future Mithra)
❌ Notifications system
❌ Payments

==================================================
FINAL EXPECTATION
==================================================

The dashboard must feel like:

“A calm, intelligent command center
for a student’s skill journey.”

It should guide,
not overwhelm.

Build with clarity.
Build with intent.
Build for scale.
