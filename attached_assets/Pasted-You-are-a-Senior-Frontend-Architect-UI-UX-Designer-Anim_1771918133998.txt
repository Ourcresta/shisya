You are a Senior Frontend Architect + UI/UX Designer + Animation Engineer.

Project: Our Shiksha (AI Learning Platform)
Goal: Implement a premium 3D ecosystem animation for the homepage hero section.

Context:
We have three circular brand assets:
1. Usha Avatar (AI Mentor)
2. Our Shiksha Logo (Learning Platform)
3. Our Udyog Logo (Industry Platform)

We want to visually represent that:
Usha connects Learning (Shiksha) and Industry (Udyog).

🎯 REQUIREMENT:

Create a smooth 3D rotating "coin-style" animation that cycles between:

• Face 1 → Usha Avatar  
• Face 2 → Our Shiksha Logo  
• Face 3 → Our Udyog Logo  

The rotation must:
- Be true 3D (not flat fade)
- Rotate on Y-axis
- Use CSS transform-style: preserve-3d
- Use perspective for depth
- Use backface-visibility: hidden
- Be fully responsive
- Be performance optimized (GPU accelerated)
- No external libraries
- No heavy JS
- Clean, modular structure

Timing:
- Each face visible for 5 seconds
- Full cycle duration: 15 seconds
- Infinite loop
- Smooth cubic-bezier transition

🎨 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:

Theme:
Dark gradient background (already exists)
Modern AI startup aesthetic
Premium glow feel

Visual Enhancements:
- Subtle outer glow around rotating object
- Slight depth shadow
- Soft hover interaction (pause animation on hover)
- Slight scale-up on hover (1.05)
- Maintain perfect circular shape

Accessibility:
- Add alt tags
- Maintain semantic structure
- No layout shift

🏗️ STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

Create:

1. Clean HTML structure
2. Production-level CSS
3. Modular class naming (BEM-style preferred)
4. Clean keyframe animation
5. Commented code blocks

Do NOT:
- Use inline styles
- Use unnecessary JS
- Break responsiveness
- Affect other page elements

---

✨ OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT (If possible):

Add:
- Soft animated gradient ring behind the rotating element
- Glow pulse every 10 seconds
- Reduce motion preference detection (prefers-reduced-motion)

---

🧠 PERFORMANCE:

Ensure:
- Hardware acceleration
- Will-change optimization
- No janky transitions
- Lightweight CSS

---

📦 OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return:

1. Final HTML
2. Final CSS
3. Optional minimal JS (only if absolutely required)
4. Clear instructions on where to place files
5. Responsive behavior notes

This must look like a premium AI EdTech platform animation suitable for a VC-funded startup landing page.

Make it elegant, modern, minimal, and powerful.
