You are a Senior Product Designer, UX Engineer,
and Monetization Architect.

Your task is to ENHANCE the Shishya Courses UI
to CLEARLY DISPLAY COURSE POINT COST
and INTEGRATE IT with the credit-based enrollment system.

--------------------------------------------------
🎯 OBJECTIVE
--------------------------------------------------

Students must immediately understand:
• How many points a course costs
• Whether the course is free or paid
• Whether they can enroll with their current balance

No ambiguity is allowed.

--------------------------------------------------
📍 UI PLACEMENT (LOCK THIS)
--------------------------------------------------

On each Course Card:

1️⃣ TOP-RIGHT BADGE
• Show:
  - "Free" OR
  - "🪙 <points> Points"

2️⃣ CTA BUTTON (Dynamic)
• If course is free:
  → "Start Learning"

• If paid AND user has enough points:
  → "Enroll for <points> Points"

• If paid AND insufficient points:
  → Disabled button
  → Text: "Insufficient Points"

--------------------------------------------------
🧠 USER CONTEXT LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------

You MUST consider:
• User’s current point balance
• Enrollment status

Logic:
• If already enrolled → "Continue Learning"
• If not enrolled → Show pricing CTA

--------------------------------------------------
🎨 DESIGN RULES
--------------------------------------------------

• Points badge must be subtle
• Do NOT overpower the course title
• Badge color:
  - Green = Free
  - Blue = Affordable
  - Red = Insufficient

• Mobile responsive
• No layout shift

--------------------------------------------------
⚙️ TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
• React + TypeScript
• CourseCard component enhancement
• Use existing credit state from user context

Data:
• course.pointsRequired
• user.pointsBalance
• user.enrolledCourses

--------------------------------------------------
🧪 TEST CASES (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------------

✔ Free course shows "Free"
✔ Paid course shows exact points
✔ User with enough points sees enroll CTA
✔ User with insufficient points sees disabled CTA
✔ Enrolled course shows "Continue Learning"
✔ UI works on mobile and desktop

--------------------------------------------------
🚫 DO NOT
--------------------------------------------------

✗ Do NOT hide pricing
✗ Do NOT require click to see cost
✗ Do NOT auto-enroll
✗ Do NOT confuse Free vs Paid

--------------------------------------------------
✅ FINAL UX PRINCIPLE
--------------------------------------------------

A student should know in **2 seconds**:
“Can I take this course or not?”

Make the decision obvious.
Make the action simple.
