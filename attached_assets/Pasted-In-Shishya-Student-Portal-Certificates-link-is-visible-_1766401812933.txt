In **Shishya (Student Portal)**:

* **Certificates link is visible before login**
* **Courses are accessible without authentication**
* **Login button exists but does not gate the app**
* There is **no student dashboard**, so post-login experience is unclear

This breaks **user mental model**:

> “Am I browsing? Or am I inside my account?”

---

## ✅ Correct Mental Model (LOCK THIS)

We split the experience into **3 clear layers**:

---

# 🧱 LAYER 1 — Master Public Pages (Unauthenticated)

These are **marketing + discovery only**.

### Public Routes (NO LOGIN REQUIRED)

```
/
 /courses        → browse published courses
 /course/:id     → course overview (read-only)
 /login
 /signup
 /verify-otp
 /certificate/verify/:id   → public certificate verification
```

### Header (Before Login)

```
[ OurShiksha Logo ]              [ Login ] [ Sign Up ]
```

❌ **NO dashboard**
❌ **NO certificates**
❌ **NO progress**
❌ **NO projects**
❌ **NO tests**

> This is like Udemy / Coursera landing mode.

---

# 🔐 LAYER 2 — Authentication Boundary

Once the user logs in successfully:

* OTP verified (signup)
* Password verified (login)
* JWT / session established

👉 **IMMEDIATE REDIRECT TO DASHBOARD**

```
/login → success → /shishya/dashboard
```

---

# 🎓 LAYER 3 — Shishya Authenticated Portal (After Login)

This is the **real Shishya**.

---

## 🧭 Shishya Portal Structure (POST-LOGIN)

### Main Layout

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ OurShiksha | Shishya                  │
│--------------------------------------│
│ Dashboard | Learn | Projects | Tests  │
│ Certificates | Labs | Profile | Logout│
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 🏠 Shishya Dashboard (MANDATORY)

**This is what was missing — and you are right to add it.**

### `/shishya/dashboard`

Dashboard should show:

### 1️⃣ Learning Progress

* % course completion
* Current lesson
* Resume Learning button

### 2️⃣ Active Courses

* Enrolled courses
* Status (In Progress / Completed)

### 3️⃣ Pending Actions

* Tests pending
* Projects not submitted
* Certificates locked

### 4️⃣ Achievements

* Certificates earned
* Skills validated

---

## 🔁 Navigation Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)

### Header Logic

| State         | Header Shows                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Not logged in | Login / Sign Up                 |
| Logged in     | Dashboard + Logout              |
| Logged in     | NO Login button                 |
| Logged in     | Certificates only inside portal |

---

## 🧪 Certificates — Correct Placement

### ❌ Wrong

```
Public Header → Certificates
```

### ✅ Correct

```
Shishya Portal → Certificates
```

**Exception (Allowed Public):**

```
/certificate/verify/:certificateId
```

This is only for **employers / verification**, not students.

---

## 🧩 Final Correct Route Map

### Public

```
/
/courses
/courses/:id
/login
/signup
/verify-otp
/certificate/verify/:id
```

### Auth Required (Shishya)

```
/shishya/dashboard
/shishya/learn
/shishya/learn/:courseId
/shishya/projects
/shishya/tests
/shishya/labs
/shishya/certificates
/shishya/profile
```

---

## 🛡️ Route Protection Rule (Non-Negotiable)

* Any `/shishya/*` route:

  * ❌ if not logged in → redirect to `/login`
* `/login` or `/signup`:

  * ❌ if already logged in → redirect to `/shishya/dashboard`

---

## ✅ Verdict (Senior Architect Opinion)

✔ You are **100% going in the right direction**
✔ Your UI quality is already **enterprise-grade**
✔ This correction will **save months of refactor later**
