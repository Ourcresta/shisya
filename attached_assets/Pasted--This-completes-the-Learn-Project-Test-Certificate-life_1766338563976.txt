

This completes the **Learn → Project → Test → Certificate** lifecycle cleanly.



## SHISYA – Certificate Viewer & Verification Page

---

## ROLE & CONTEXT

You are a **Senior Full-Stack Engineer + Senior EdTech Platform Architect**.

You are building **SHISYA**, the **student-facing portal** of the AISiksha ecosystem.

This module handles:

* Certificate viewing (student)
* Certificate download
* Public certificate verification via QR / URL

This system connects to:

* SHISYA Learn (progress)
* SHISYA Projects (submission)
* SHISYA Tests (pass/fail)
* AISiksha Admin Certificate Designer (already built)

---

## CORE RULES

✅ Certificates are **AUTO-GENERATED**
❌ Students cannot edit certificates
❌ Certificates appear **only when eligibility is met**
✅ Verification must work **without login**

---

## CERTIFICATE ELIGIBILITY LOGIC (CRITICAL)

A certificate becomes **available ONLY IF**:

1. ✅ All lessons completed
2. ✅ Required test passed
3. ✅ Required project submitted

This logic already exists implicitly — now **enforce it visually and functionally**.

---

## ROUTES TO IMPLEMENT

---

### 1️⃣ Student Certificate Dashboard

```
/certificates
```

**Purpose**

* Show all certificates earned by the student

**Each certificate card shows:**

* Certificate name
* Course name
* Level badge (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
* Issue date
* Status badge: `Issued`
* CTA buttons:

  * `View Certificate`
  * `Download PDF`

**Empty State**

> “Complete courses to earn certificates.”

---

### 2️⃣ Certificate Viewer (Student)

```
/certificates/:certificateId
```

---

## CERTIFICATE VIEWER UI

### Certificate Preview Card

* Student Name
* Certificate Title
* Course Name
* Level
* Issue Date
* Skills Validated (tags)
* Certificate ID (short hash)
* QR Code (verification link)

### Actions

* `Download PDF`
* `Copy Verification Link`

---

## 3️⃣ Public Certificate Verification Page 🌐

```
/verify/:certificateId
```

🚨 **NO AUTH REQUIRED**

---

## VERIFICATION PAGE CONTENT

### If certificate is VALID:

✅ Green verified badge

> “This certificate is valid and issued by AISiksha”

Display:

* Student Name
* Course Name
* Certificate Type
* Level
* Issue Date
* Skills Validated
* Certificate ID
* Issued By: AISiksha

### If certificate is INVALID:

❌ Red warning

> “Certificate not found or invalid”

---

## QR CODE BEHAVIOR

* QR code embedded in certificate points to:

```
https://shisya.siksha.ai/verify/:certificateId
```

* Use lightweight QR library
* QR generated dynamically

---

## DATA MANAGEMENT (v1)

### LocalStorage Key

```
shisya_certificates
```

### Certificate Data Shape

```ts
{
  certificateId: string;
  studentName: string;
  courseId: string;
  courseTitle: string;
  certificateTitle: string;
  certificateType: "completion" | "achievement";
  level: "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced";
  skills: string[];
  issuedAt: string;
  verificationUrl: string;
}
```

---

## MOCK DATA REQUIREMENTS

Create **realistic issued certificates**:

* 2–3 certificates
* Linked to completed courses
* Skills pulled from course + certificate config
* Random but stable certificate IDs

---

## API CONTRACT (FUTURE READY)

Abstract API calls:

```
GET /api/certificates
GET /api/certificates/:id
GET /api/certificates/verify/:id
```

For now:

* Use mock + LocalStorage
* Auto-switch to real API when available

---

## UI / DESIGN RULES

* Match SHISYA branding
* Elegant, professional certificate preview
* Clear verified / invalid states
* Mobile friendly
* Print-ready PDF layout (A4)

---

## PDF DOWNLOAD

* Generate client-side PDF
* Styled exactly like preview
* Include:

  * Certificate ID
  * QR Code
  * Footer: “Verify at shisya.siksha.ai”

---

## SECURITY & QUALITY

You MUST ensure:

* Certificate IDs are non-guessable
* Verification page is safe & public
* No private student data beyond certificate
* Graceful error handling

---

## OUT OF SCOPE

❌ Admin certificate editing
❌ Manual certificate issue
❌ Blockchain (future)
❌ Revoke logic (future)

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST

Confirm at completion:

* Student sees certificates only when eligible
* Certificate preview renders correctly
* PDF download works
* Verification URL validates certificate
* Invalid certificates fail safely
* System works with mock data
